## Variables
Variables in EasyScript are used to store data. You can create a variable by simply assigning a value to a name. Variables do not need to be declared with a specific type, as EasyScript is dynamically typed.

```easyscript
number = 10
text = "Hello, EasyScript!"
flag = True
```

Variables can be reassigned to new values at any time.

```easyscript
number = 20
text = "Goodbye, EasyScript!"
flag = False
```
