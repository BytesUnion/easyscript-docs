## Basic Arithmetic
EasyScript supports  arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You can perform arithmetic operations directly in your script.

```easyscript
a = 5 + 3      >> Addition, a is now 8
b = 10 - 2     >> Subtraction, b is now 8
c = 4 * 2      >> Multiplication, c is now 8
d = 16 / 2     >> Division, d is now 8
```

You can also use parentheses to control the order of operations.

```easyscript
result = (5 + 3) * 2   >> result is now 16
```
