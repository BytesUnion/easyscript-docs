# Data Types
EasyScript supports several basic data types. Here are the most commonly used ones:

- Numbers: Used for both integer and floating-point arithmetic.
- Strings: Sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes.
- Booleans: Represent `True` or `False` values.
- Lists: Ordered collections of elements.
- Objects: Collections of key-value pairs.
