# Getting to Know the Basic Syntax of EasyScript

## Comments
In EasyScript, comments are lines of text that are not executed. They are used to explain code or to leave notes for yourself and others. You can write a comment by starting the line with `>>` or ending the line with it.

```ess
>> This is a comment
>> Comments are ignored by the interpreter
```
